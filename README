Readme / documentation for the execo package
********************************************

Execo offers a Python API for asynchronous control of local or remote,
standalone or parallel, unix processes. It is especially well suited
for quickly and easily scripting workflows of parallel/distributed
operations on local or remote hosts: automate a scientific workflow,
conduct computer science experiments, perform automated tests,
etc. The core python package is ``execo``. The ``execo_g5k`` package
provides a set of tools and extensions for the `Grid5000
<https://www.grid5000.fr>`_ testbed. The ``execo_engine`` package
provides tools to ease the development of computer sciences
experiments.

platforms
---------

- works on linux (primary development platform), darwin (macosx)

- should work on bsd (not tested)

- don't know on windows or cygwin (not tested)

prerequisites
-------------

execo installation absolutely requires ``python`` 2.6 / 2.7 or
>=3.2. ``execo_g5k`` needs ``python-requests``. Optionnal packages are
(debian package names, in order of decreasing importance):

- under python 2.6, ``python-argparse`` is needed for
  `execo_engine.engine.Engine`

- ``python-keyring`` for allowing storage of `execo_g5k.api_utils` api
  password in the desktop environment keyring (allowing asking it only
  once).

- ``python-psycopg2`` for optimized interface to Grid5000 OAR planning.

- ``sphinx-doc``, ``graphviz`` for building the documentation (usually
  not needed for regular users).

- ``python-matplotlib`` (>= 1.2.0) for some graphical representations.

- ``python-networkx``, ``python-pygraphviz``, ``graphviz``  for module ``execo_g5k.topology``

At runtime, connecting to remote hosts requires ``ssh``, ``scp`` or
similar connection tools, and optionnaly ``taktuk`` (probably >=
3.6. http://taktuk.gforge.inria.fr/). `execo.action.ChainPut` requires
bourne shell and ``netcat`` on remote hosts.

installation
------------

To install execo from a source package (.tar.gz) or from the git
tree::

 $ python setup.py install [--user]

to build documentation (if sphinx is available)::

 $ python setup.py build_doc

to install documentation (if sphinx is available)::

 $ python setup.py install_doc

It is possible to install execo automatically with ``pip`` or
``easy_install``::

 $ pip install --user execo

or::

 $ easy_install --user execo

It is possible to generate a debian package. For example, in the execo
package toplevel dir, run (the .deb will be generated in ../)::

 $ debuild --no-tgz-check -b -i -I -k<signing key id>

Usage
=====

Bugs
====

Execo is regularly used to perform advanced experiments and
administration / monitoring tasks, in and outside Grid5000. We
actively fix bugs. Bugs should be reported to http://bugzilla.inria.fr

How to contribute
=================

- start contributing by sending clean patches or report bugs.

- stay consistent with the coding and naming style

- code must be compatible with python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2+ (see
  http://execo.gforge.inria.fr/doc/latest-stable/python2-python3.html)

- use the core systems provided (eg. the configuration system, the tty
  coloring system, the logger, etc.) instead of developing your own.

- provide documented code (internal documentation as well as user
  documentation where needed)

- ask a core developer before adding a dependency or dealing with
  threads, signals (particularly: creating threads)

- indent with spaces, not tabs. one level of indentation is four
  spaces (if needed: use ``reindent.py -rnv .`` in execo top
  directory)

- recommended commit messages format:

  ``[<module_name>] <category>: commit message``.

  - <module_name> can be execo, execo_g5k, execo_engine. Omit if
    commit is not specific to a module.

  - <category> is free form but should indicate which part(s) of the
    module the commit affects. Omit if a commit is not specific to a
    module part.
